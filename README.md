 Fake Currency Detection using Machine Learning

 Project Overview
This project aims to detect **real vs fake banknotes** using machine learning. It uses the **UCI Banknote Authentication Dataset**, which contains statistical features extracted from images of currency notes.

Features Used
- **Variance** – texture variation
- **Skewness** – asymmetry
- **Kurtosis** – sharpness of the note
- **Entropy** – randomness

Algorithms Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
